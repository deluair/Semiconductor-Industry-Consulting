        # - Model leading-edge foundry oligopoly entrenchment (e.g., market share changes).
        # - Simulate fabless company geographic distribution shifts (e.g., based on talent, incentives in regions).
        # - Evolve foundry-fabless relationships (e.g., new partnership scores based on co-development efforts).
        # - Simulate vertical integration trends (e.g., a fabless company might acquire design capabilities or vice-versa).
        # Example: If a leading foundry heavily invests in a new node (from TechEvolution context or its own strategy)
        # and its yields are good (internal attribute), its market share for that node might increase.

        # - Track specialty material security strategies (e.g., companies investing in alternative suppliers or stockpiling).

        # --- Downstream Value Chain Reconfiguration (Placeholder) ---
