        # --- Client Need Transformation (Placeholder) ---
        # - Based on geopolitical risks (from GeopoliticalModule), supply chain issues (from CapacityDemand), 
        #   client priorities might shift (e.g., increase 'supply_security_priority_score' for client companies).
        # - This could be a global variable or an aggregated metric.
        # Example: global_context['client_need_shift'] = {'supply_security': 0.7, 'cost_optimization': 0.3}

        # --- Consulting Service Portfolio Evolution (Placeholder) ---
        for consultancy in self.consultancies:
            # - Consultancies might adapt their service offerings (e.g., invest in 'geopolitical_scenario_planning_capability').
            # - This could mean increasing a score for that capability or adding new service IDs to their portfolio.
            # - Their 'geopolitical_expertise_score' or 'technical_semiconductor_knowledge_score' might evolve.
            # Example: If global_context['client_need_shift']['supply_security'] > 0.6:
            #    current_geopol_score = consultancy.get_attribute('geopolitical_expertise_score')
            #    if current_geopol_score is not None:

            pass

        # --- Competitive Landscape Reshaping (Placeholder) ---
        # - New boutique consultancies might emerge (could be modeled by adding new CompanyModels of type Consultancy).
        # - Existing consultancies might gain/lose market share based on their capabilities and client needs alignment.

        # --- Talent & Capability Requirements (Placeholder) ---
        # - Consultancies might try to recruit talent (increase 'consultant_count') with specific skills 
        #   (e.g., 'geopolitical_analysts_hired').
